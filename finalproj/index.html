							<h2>Problem Statement</h2>
						</header>
						<p>Traditional evaluation methods rely on a final exam or assessment to measure a student's growth. However, exam scores often give noisy, inaccurate results, especially for students who aren't good test-takers.</p><p>In our project, we explore the ways a studentâ€™s <b>process</b> can be used as a better measurement of their growth in ability. To examine these effects, we will use student submissions in the <b>Hour of Code</b> task on <a href="code.org">Code.org</a>, and try to evaluate students using modern ML techniques.</p>

							<h2>Data Visualization</h2>
						</header>
						<p>The first major deliverable for our project was creating a command-line interface for inspecting and visualizing student data.</p>
						<p>We wanted this tool to be fast and easy to use, enabling us to skim through hundreds of submissions quickly and get a good sense of the data we were working with. We wrote the tool in Python and allowed the user step through different students, each with different submissions, for all 10 problems using keyboard shortcuts.</p>
						<p>The interface contains options to view code in the autoformatted form or in the abstract syntax tree form, turn on/off our predictive algorithm, and show/hide the student's final report card.</p>
						<p>Our goal for this data visualization tool is to allow future research on this dataset to more easily examine specific data examples, in order to qualitatively measure a model's predictive ability.</p>

							<h2>Generating + Verifying Grammars</h2>
						</header>
						<p>In our third assignment, we explored how to use Chris's idea-to-text engine with our grammars to randomly generate student code with rubric labels.</p>
						<p>However, since we were going to be generating our data from a grammar for each of the problems we were interested in, we needed some way of evaluating whether our grammars were complete enough, and sufficiently approximated the true data's distribution.</p>
						<p>To do so, we wrote grammars for problems 1, 2, 3, and 4. We then evaluated our grammars using completeness as a primary metric, and then L2 distance as a secondary metric. While we did not get as high accuracy on our grammars for problems 3 or 4 compared to problem 1, our grammars still performed well given the Zipf distribution of the data.</p>

						<p>Our first idea was to create a graph of all submissions, in which each node was a submission and each edge meant that the second submission came after the first. However, trying this led to an extremely dense graph, with each submission with many edges coming out of it. From this, it became clear that we needed to be more thoughtful about how we were representing sequences.</p>

					<div class="modal-body">
						<p>Our second idea was to leverage each pair of submissions and try to learn some random walk model that could understand the path a student was taking and what their next submission might be. However, with so many pairs, this approach also quickly became infeasible.</p>

						<p>Our last approach, which was a part of our final design, involved trying to find simple patterns instead of trying to generalize across all possible pairs of submissions.

							<h2>Final Design</h2>
						</header>
						<p>The previous designs were difficult to use on because of their reliance on pairwise or graph-wide relationships between submissions. Since the space of possible paths and pairs is enormously large, this quickly made our previous approaches infeasible for data-efficient ability calculations.</p>
						<p>To solve this problem, we decided to transform our data into rubric space, which meant making predictions on all submissions, and then representing each submission using its binary rubric item predictions. This was essentially a form of dimensionality reduction, because each set of rubric items still represents the current student's progress on a problem.</p>
						<p>With this transformation, we were able to calculate a score for relative student learning using a transition matrix.</p>

					<h2>Surprisal Detection</h2>
				</header>
				<p>The results of our experiments found examples of student submissions who had interesting sequences of submissions (possibly examples of cheating, as the student suddenly submitted the correct answer very abruptly). However, assuming the best case scenario, the results of our growth scoring is intended to showcase students that exhibit a high level of "surprisal" in their submissions - a large gain in solving rubric item problems is a strong sign of definitive learning.</p>
				<p>We chose to model a large "surprisal" as a large change in ability obtained via changes in rubric items across submissions. In order to calculate this, we used a transition matrix to describe the change in score for any rubric item change.</p>
			</div>
		</section>

		<section class="main style1">
			<div class="container">
				<header class="major">
					<h2>Transition Matrix</h2>
				</header>
				<p><span class="image right"><img class="matrix" src="images/trans_matrix.png" alt="" /></span>We use a transition matrix to help assign a transition learning score for each rubric item from one submission to its subsequent submission. For an (i, j) entry, i refers to whether or not the first submission contains the current rubric item and j refers to whether or not the second submission contains the current rubric item. 0 denotes not containing a rubric item and 1 denotes containing a rubric item.</p>
				<p>Therefore, we assign a transition score of +1 (applied to a discount factor which we shall in the following section) when a student goes from 1 to 0 (i.e. having a label to not having a label, yay!) and a transition score of -0.5 when a student goes from 0 to 1 (this allows a student to be able to recover by going from 1 to 0 and gaining a learning transition score of 1 discounted by a factor). If a student stays consistent (0 to 0 or 1 to 1) for a rubric item, then we give a transition score of 0.
				</p>
				<br/>
				<header class="major">
					<h3>Discount Factor</h3>
				</header>
				<p>When we have a transition score of +1 (i.e. when a student goes from 1 to 0 or from having a rubric item to not having that rubric item), we apply a discount factor of 0.9 for every time we have seen a transition from 1 to 0 after the first transition from 1 to 0 for this rubric item. For example, if a student goes from 1 to 0, then 0 to 1, then 1 to 0, the first transition score will be +1, the second transition score will be -0.5, and the third transition score will be +0.9.
				</p>
				<div class="container score">
					<img class="score" src="images/score.png" alt="" />
				</div>
				<p>For an individual problem, a studentâ€™s problem score is calculated by first taking the sum of the transition scores and then dividing by the square root of the number of submissions. This helps us to differentiate between students who may have spammed submissions and students who submit a reasonable number of submissions. We take the square root of the number of submissions to prevent the problem score from shrinking too quickly. To calculate a studentâ€™s total learning score, we sum up all of these problem scores.</p>

						<h3>Low Ability Gain Distribution</h3>
						<p>The above student had a very low estimated change in ability, even though they got a perfect submission in every problem on the first try.

					<h2>Future Work</h2>
				</header>
				<p>In this project, we both learned the immense care it takes to model and generate data for the zero-shot learning problem, as well as the difficulties of working with time-series data across many different dimensions.</p>
				<p>To extend this project further, our next steps would likely look at incorporating some measure of confidence in our ability scores for students, as we want predictions on students with few submissions to be less confident than students with many submissions and attempted many problems. Additionally, we may also want to look at weighting categories of rubric items differently from others. For example, for loops and repeats may be more difficult to learn, so we want to "reward" ability scores that showcase a lot of development in those fields.</p>
